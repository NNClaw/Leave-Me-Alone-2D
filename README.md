# Leave Me Alone
 
This is my take on endless runner for mobile platforms (iOS and Android). Endless runner genre suggests, that the main goal is to run as far as possible, where the gameplay goes faster after a set period of time. My idea expands this main goal by eliminating life system and implementing an enemy, which will be closer each time the player hits an obstacle (kind of like in Subway Surfers).

This project is in active development, where it is in a state of further core gameplay development.

***Controls***

As this is a game for mobile platforms, the main input is user's touch screen. Knowing this, the controls are the following:

* The player runs automatically, therefore the only way to control the character is to Swipe Up to Jump, Swipe Down to Slide and Swipe Left or Right to shove the obstacle (in development).

***Game conditions***

* There are 3 types of obstacles: obstacles, which can be avoided only by jumping over, obstacles, which can only be slid under and obstacles, which can only be shoved;
* Each time the player hits an obstacle, the player enters in invulnerable state, where they can not be damaged and an enemy gets closer;
* The game is over, when the enemy cathes up with the player.

***Features in development or planed to be developed***

* Enemy feature;
* Player's ability to shove obstacles and implementing those obstacles
* UI;
* Gameplay bonuses;
* Visual redevelopment (current assets are maily used for testing).

**Unity version: ***2020.3.24f1*****
