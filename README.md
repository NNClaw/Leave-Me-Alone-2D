# Leave Me Alone
 
This is my take on endless runner for mobile platforms (iOS and Android). Endless runner genre suggests, that the main goal is to run as far as possible, where the gameplay goes faster after a set period of time.

This project is in active development, where it is in a state of further core gameplay development.
